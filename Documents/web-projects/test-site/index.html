    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <P> My name is Ronald Davenport. I am 19 years old, born and raised in Houston,TX.</P>
      
    <h2>Why i joined DigitalCrafts</h2>
       <p>Ever since a child, i've always had a fascination with computers, and just tech in general.
         In the 7th grade, this fascination grew larger and i began researching careers i could pursure within tech. 
         This led me to stumble upon, Software Engineering. From what i could see, it was almost a perfect match for me.
         Pay was great, benefits were amazing as well, but must importantly, i realized i could do what i loved for a living.
         I believe when choosing a career, you should always go with what you're most passionate about. My goal is to have a career where I
         actually enjoy waking up in the morning, rather then it being a nagging, annoying way to pay bills.
         Through my journey of achieving this goal, i stumbled upon a video about Coding Bootcamps. The video
         explained how bootcamps were the quickest, but also intense, way of entering the tech industry. I did further 
         research on bootcamps and realized this was perfect for me. I researched the best bootcamps in my area and DigitalCrafts
         was at the top of the list. With no hesitation i applied, and here i am 3 months later. A DigitalCrafts student
